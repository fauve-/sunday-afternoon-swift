Another in the series of sunday afternoon projects
just testing out swift. I'm a linux dev by trade, and have only super-rarely worked within the apple ecosystem
so this is meant to be run on a linux box (I used arch for my box).

compiler and stuff:
"""
[~]$ swift
Welcome to Swift version 2.2-dev (LLVM 46be9ff861, Clang 4deb154edc, Swift 778f82939c). Type :help for assistance.
"""

this was the challenge:
http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Globally_replace_text_in_several_files

todo:
make a class to handle the file handle
make sure the unsafe stuff gets deallocated
use some threads for the bbbbonus points

notes:
I used full file paths for my files to change
